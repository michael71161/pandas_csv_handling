# Pandas module and CSV file handling.
*******************************************************

We have a very large csv file -2018 Central Park Squirrel Count 
We want to count from this file :
- grey squirrels count
- red squirrels count
- black squirrels count
And to save it as a new csv file contains the squirrels count as a csv dataframe (table)
